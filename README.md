### <i> About Me</i>
    
Hi there 👋 Myself Swastik and you can call me Loki also, completely your choice. I'm a small-time developer and I have a bit of experience in HTML, CSS, Python and JavaScript. Aside of Coding, I also like doing stuff like listening to songs, playing games and chat with my friends on Discord.
